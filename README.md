Home Security System using Raspberry Pi and PIR Sensor  

Project Overview  
This project implements a cost-effective Home Security System using a Raspberry Pi and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. It detects intruders by sensing motion and sends real-time push notifications to the userâ€™s smartphone using Pushbullet.  

Features  
Motion detection using PIR sensor  
Real-time alerts via Pushbullet notifications  
Wi-Fi-enabled security system using Raspberry Pi  
Affordable and easy-to-implement IoT solution  

Components Required  
Raspberry Pi (with Raspbian OS installed)  
PIR Sensor  
Jumper Wires  

How It Works  
1. Motion Detection: The PIR sensor detects movement and sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi.  
2. Trigger Alert: The Raspberry Pi processes the signal and sends a push notification using Pushbullet API.  
3. Real-time Notification: The user receives an alert on their smartphone.
